# Eat-Da-Burger!

## Node Express Handlebars ORM

### Deployed at -- <>

### Overview

This application creates a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). It follows the requisite MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and uses Handlebars to generate the HTML.

### How the app works

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger moves to the right side of the page.

* The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
